      <h3><a href="#education"></a>Education</h3>
      <p>I grew up in a town in what is known to be smackdab in the middle of the United States, in a small town in Missouri. I attended high school at <a href="http://elsberryschools.com/"><b>Elsberry High School</b></a> and graduated in May of 2011. While attending High School I also attended <a href="http://pltc.k12.mo.us/"><b>Pike-Lincoln Technical Center</b></a> for two years and participated in the <a href="http://pltc.k12.mo.us/electronic_technology.html">Computer & Neworking Technology</a> class.</p>

      <p>After I graudated High School I left the next fall and took my first semester of college at <a href="http://nwmissouri.edu">Northwest Missouri State</a>. However after my first semester I moved south and now I'm attending classes at Shelton State Community College in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.</p>
      <p>While education is something that is important to me, I value my family more than anything in the world.</p>


      <h3><a href="#interests"></a>Interests</h3>
      <p>At a young age, I took a keen interest in computers and anything electronic. I'm interested in learning how things work and seeing if I can adapt that to my needs(this site is actually the result of that interest!)</p>
      <p>I can remember getting a toy truck and then after playing with it and getting bored of it just zooming around the floor, taking it down to my room in the basement and <em>taking it apart.</em> I wanted to see how it worked and what I learned at that young age was there are a lot of little screws to a simple looking truck.</p>
      <p>Other than knowing how/why things work I enjoy <strong>gaming</strong>, <strong>family</strong>, and <strong>web design/development.</strong> If you'd like to see some of the projects I've completed or am working on click on the <a href="/about/projects">My Projects</a> link.
